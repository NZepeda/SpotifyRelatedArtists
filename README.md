# SpotifyRelatedArtists

This simple web app was created using NodeJs, AngularJs and ExpressJs. It makes use of Spotify Web API to get the details on
the artists. For the suggestions dropdown, the [twitter-typeahead.js](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js) library was used.

The app is available to view on [Heroku](https://spotify-related-artists.herokuapp.com/).
